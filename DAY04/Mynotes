1. Address (in Networking)
Definition:
In networking, an address refers to a unique identifier assigned to a device (like a computer, smartphone, or printer) so it can be located and communicated with on a network.

Types of Addresses:
MAC Address (Media Access Control):

A unique hardware address for network interfaces.

Format: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

Assigned by device manufacturer.

IP Address (Internet Protocol):

A logical address used to identify devices on a network.

Changes depending on network location (e.g., home Wi-Fi vs office).

 2. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)
Definition:
An IP Address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

Types:
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):

32-bit number: 192.168.1.1

Supports about 4.3 billion addresses.

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):

128-bit number: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

Supports a vastly larger number of addresses.

IP Address Classification:
Private IP: Used within a local network (e.g., 192.168.0.1)

Public IP: Used for communication over the internet.

3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Definition:
TCP is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite that ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.

Key Features:
Connection-Oriented: Establishes a connection before data is sent.

Reliable Delivery: Guarantees data reaches its destination without errors or loss.

Three-Way Handshake:

SYN (synchronize)

SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge)

ACK (acknowledge)

Used By: Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP).

4. Network
Definition:
A network is a group of two or more interconnected computers that can share resources and communicate with each other.

Types of Networks:
LAN (Local Area Network):

Covers a small area (e.g., home, office).

WAN (Wide Area Network):

Covers large geographical areas (e.g., the internet).

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):

Spans a city or campus.

Components:
Router: Connects networks.

Switch: Connects devices within a network.

Modem: Connects to the internet.

5. ISP (Internet Service Provider)
Definition:
An ISP is a company that provides users with access to the Internet and related services such as email, web hosting, and domain registration.

Roles of ISP:
Assigns public IP addresses.

Provides broadband/fiber/dial-up connections.

Offers DNS services (resolves domain names to IPs).

May enforce data limits or speeds (bandwidth).

Examples:
Jio, Airtel, BSNL (India)

Comcast, Verizon, AT&T (USA)
